## What I learned
From the last project I made (Iguana Weather App) I noticed that I tend to try to slam my way through problems
by just trying every possible solution in a random order. This has proven to be very ineffective and time- and 
mental energy-consuming, so I tried to stay mindful of the moments when I try to jam my way through, I would sit
back, take my notebook and  try to reason the problem down in parts. I'm very happy to notice that I can work
more efficiently because of this and I feel that I've grown as a dev and also a person by this simple act.
